- [bug]: blocktools should be visible only when moving the mouse and dissappear when you start editing

  - add to bookmarks (in drafts?)
  - open in a new window
  - delete document
- [feat]: change bookmark icon to the normal bookmark
- [feat]: what should we do when the first document is a transclusion
  - the title of the document should be the text of the first block with content
    - if the first (or current) block has just a transclusion, take the text of the next block
- [nice-to-have]: when navigating in the editor with the arrow keys, and I'm in the beginnign of a multi-line transclusion, I can't move to the next line below the transclusion. I does happen correctly when there's a one-line transclusion but not multi-line.
