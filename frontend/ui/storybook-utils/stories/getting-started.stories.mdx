# Getting Started

This is the Design System that powers the [Mintter](https://mintter.com)
platform. Under the hood, we use [Stitches](https://stitches.dev) for a modern
CSS-in-JS approach and [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com) for out-of-the-box
accessible primitives to build our components.

## Setup

1.  Install the `@mintter/ui` package using your preferred package manager.

```sh
$ npm install @mintter/ui
```

2.  Wrap your application with the `Theme` component.

```tsx
import {Theme} from '@mintter/ui/theme'

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <Theme>
      <YourApp />
    </Theme>
  )
}
```

## Principles

Since we try to avoid over-abstracting things, we won't export all UI components
from here initially. Our approach is to export the most basic primitives that
you can leverage to build more complex UI patterns. Once we find a pattern is
repeated in multiple places, then we abstract it and add it to this package.

> Sometimes the best abstraction, is no abstraction at all.
