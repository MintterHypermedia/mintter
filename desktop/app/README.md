# Mintter Desktop App

This is the desktop app wrapper of the Mintter App. To learn more about the
folder structure see https://tauri.app.

## Building

You should run `./dev run-desktop` or `./dev build-desktop` from the repos root
to run this app.

## Logging

The log level can be configured by setting the `RUST_LOG` environment variable:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug ./dev run-desktop
```

The log level can also be configured **per-module**, so one choose to receive
trace logs from one module while completely ignoring other logs:

```bash
RUST_LOG=mintter::extensions=trace ./dev run-desktop
```

The module name can be easily found in the logs, since itâ€™s always the third
item:

RUST_LOG=trace,mintter::daemon=off ./dev run-desktop
```

```bash
RUST_LOG=mintter::daemon/foo ./dev run-desktop
```
