# Mintter

Mintter is a decentralized knowledge collaboration application for open
communities powered by a knowledge graph.

You can read more about the product and why we are here on our website:
https://mintter.com.

## ⚠️ Stability

This is alpha-quality software. Have a copy of anything valuable you put into
Mintter.

We expect to make a breaking (incompatible) change to the data model in
following weeks.

## Building

You can build the project on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Although using Windows
for active development is probably going to be painful (unless using WSL).

The setup for Linux, and macOS is simplified using the
[Nix Package Manager](https://nixos.org/nix), and [Direnv](https://direnv.net).
The setup on Linux is a bit more involved due to dependencies on system
libraries that don't work well on non-NixOS Linux distros.

The bare minimum required for compilation is to have Go, and NodeJS toolchains
installed.

See the [developer setup](./docs/dev-setup.md) page for more info on how to
build the project.

## Docker

You can build docker images for different modules of the system. Always from the
repo root path you can issue the following commands:

daemon: `docker build -t mintterd . -f ./backend/cmd/mintterd/Dockerfile`

gateway: `docker build -t gateway . -f ./frontend/gateway/Dockerfile`

### Deploy a Site

To deploy a group into a site, make sure you have a domain name <`hostname`> and
a server with at least 1GB RAM and 512MB free space in root partition. Run the
folloging command in the server:

```shell
sh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mintterteam/mintter/master/site_deployment.sh) --hostname https://example.com
```

replacing `https://example.com` by your <`hostname`> If everything went well,
after some seconds, you should be watching a final output line like
`https://example.com/secret-invite/XXXX`. You should paste that link back into
the owner's application to register the newly created site and start publihing.
The site deployment workspace will default to `~/.mtt-site`.

### Update a site

If you only want to update the site to the latest version, the easiest way is to
rerun the [installation command](#deploy-a-site) with the same hostname. Note
that if you change the hostname, a new secret invite will be generated to the
new site and old one can't be retrieved again.

So, if you want to update the hostname, we recomend to either backup the default
site workspace (`~/.mtt-site`) or generate the new site in a different workspace
until everything is checkd to work properly:

```shell
sh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mintterteam/mintter/master/site_deployment.sh) --workspace /home/root/new-path --hostname https://new-domain.com
```
