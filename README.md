# Mintter

This is main repository for the Mintter project.

![Deploy Frontend & Publish](https://github.com/mintterteam/mintter/workflows/Deploy%20Frontend%20&%20Publish/badge.svg?branch=master)

## Prerequisites

You need to have [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix) package manager installed on your
machine to work with this repository.

To setup Nix see [this](/docs/nix.md).

## Getting Started

Assuming you have the prerequisites:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `redo -j20` to build everything.
3. Run `./scripts/run-frontend.sh` to run the frontend dev server.
4. Run `./scripts/run-backend.sh` to start the backend.
5. Access the frontend URL from the browser.

### gRPC

We are using [gRPC](https://grpc.io) for communication between frontend and
backend. Take a look inside `.proto` files [here](/proto).

### Frontend vs. Backend

Frontend is the NextJS web app. For production, we'll use `next export` to
generate static assets and use it as an SPA. These static assets are going to be
served from the backend.

Backend is a long-running program that lives on user's local machine. It handles
all the p2p networking, IPFS and Lightning Network stuff. It exposes the gRPC
API for frontend to use.

### Submodules

Some of the third-party projects we are using are included as submodules into
this repository. This makes it easier for us to contribute upstream. We use
[git-subtrac](https://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtrac) to mitigate many of the
quirks of submodules. To avoid some headaches run this to configure your local
git repo:

```shell
git config submodule.recurse true
```

### Submodules troubleshooting

we found that sometimes git submodules stop working:

```bash
â†’ git submodule update
error: Server does not allow request for unadvertised object d755705398300d4ee611f0edcb84b0b60cb670c5
Fetched in submodule path 'third_party/go-threads', but it did not contain d755705398300d4ee611f0edcb84b0b60cb670c5. Direct fetching of that commit failed.
```

the way we found to fix it is running these commands:

```bash
git submodule deinit --all -f
rm -rf .git/modules
git pull
git module update --init
git config submodule.recurse true
git pull
```

let us know if you find other issues!
