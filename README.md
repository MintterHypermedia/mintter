# Mintter

Mintter is a decentralized knowledge collaboration application for open
communities powered by a knowledge graph.

You can read more about the product and why we are here on our website:
https://mintter.com.

### Hypermedia Protocol

Mintter supports the new [Hypermedia Web Protocol](https://hyper.media/). This
open protocol supports secure identities, version control, semantic documents, multimedia,
and groups/organizations.

### Desktop App + Web Server

This repo includes:

1. Mintter Desktop - app for writing, reading, and saving Hypermedia content
2. Mintter Web Server - public web experience, a read-only portal of the Hypermedia network

## ⚠️ Stability

This is alpha-quality software. Have a copy of anything valuable you put into
Mintter.

## Dev Environment

See the [developer setup](./docs/docs/dev-setup.md) page for detailed instructions.

The dev environment on macOS+Linux uses the [Nix Package Manager](https://nixos.org/nix),
and [Direnv](https://direnv.net). The setup on Linux is a bit more involved due
to dependencies on system libraries that don't work well on non-NixOS Linux distros.

The bare minimum required for compilation is to have Go, and NodeJS toolchains
installed.

[./dev](./dev) is the main dev CLI. Run `./dev` to list commands, including:

- `./dev run-desktop`
- `./dev build-desktop`
- `./dev run-site`
- `./dev build-site`

To run the dev build with the production network, use the following command:

```
MINTTER_P2P_TESTNET_NAME="" ./dev run-desktop
```

## Group sites

Group sites need two programs to run. The daemon which includes the P2P node (go app) 
and the forntend that renders documents (nextjs app). However for a production 
deployment everything is orchestrated by docker compose. Read next sections for how to 
either deploy a site on a production server or run it locally in dev mode

### Deploy a Group Site

To deploy a group into a site, make sure you have a domain name and
a server with at least 1GB RAM and 512MB free space in root partition. Run the
folloging command in the server:

```shell
sh <(curl -sL https://go.hyper.media/website_deployment.sh) https://example.com
```

replacing `https://example.com` by your <`address`> If everything went well,
after some seconds, you should be watching a final output line like
`https://example.com/secret-invite/XXXX`. You should paste that link back into
the owner's application to register the newly created site and start publihing.
The site deployment workspace will default to `~/.mtt-site`.

#### Auto-Update a Site

If you want the site to auto update to latest stable images when they are pushed,
just execute the installation command with the `--auto-update` flag. Ex:

```shell
sh <(curl -sL https://go.hyper.media/website_deployment.sh) https://example.com --auto-update
```

### Build Group sites (devs only)

You can build docker images for different modules of the system. Always from the
repo root path you can issue the following commands:

daemon: `docker build -t mintterd . -f ./backend/cmd/mintterd/Dockerfile`

gateway: `docker build -t gateway . -f ./frontend/gateway/Dockerfile`

### Debug Group sites (devs only)

To launch group sites building blocks independently, always from the
repo root path you can issue the following commands:

daemon: `MINTTER_P2P_TESTNET_NAME="" go run ./backend/cmd/mintter-site -data-dir=~/.mttsite-dev -p2p.port=57000  -grpc.port=57002 -http.port=57001 -p2p.no-relay "http://localhost:3000"`

gateway: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRPC_HOST="http://localhost:57001/" PORT=3000 GW_NEXT_HOST="http://localhost:3000" yarn site`
